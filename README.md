# Todo-web-application

This project is a simple To-do web application build with Next.js, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and view the list of to-do items with pagination support. The application state is persisted in browser local storage to retain the to-do items even after a page refresh.
